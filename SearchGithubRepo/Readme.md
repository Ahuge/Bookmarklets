The Search Github Repo bookmarklet will ask you for a search term and a language, both are optional but you must supply at least one of them.

Special Considerations?
-------------
> ***It is recommended that for this bookmarklet you aquire an api token and modify the "authentication" var at the top of the js file.***
You will need to go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and generate yourself a new script token.

The reason generating a token is recommended is to raise the rate limiting that GitHub puts on their api. You can see the rules here: https://developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit/
